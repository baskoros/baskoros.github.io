Hi there. This is a blog acting as my medium to post dev related content, whether it's a dev problem I've encountered or interesting ideas that I might have had the time to explore in my free time. Some future content may be linked to my Medium account.

If you have any inquiries, my Twitter account is on the bottom of the page. I'm more than happy to discuss dev related stuff on the platform.

Happy reading!
